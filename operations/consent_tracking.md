## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the workflow for collecting, recording, and managing informed consent from research participants in the Skills-Based Hiring Sentiment Study. It ensures compliance with ethical standards and maintains a clear audit trail.

## 2. Consent Collection Workflow

### 2.1 Who Collects Consent
- **Primary:** Project Coordinator (Xavier Rivera)
- **Secondary:** Designated school-based PD coordinators (for survey distribution)

### 2.2 When Consent Is Collected
- **Before any data collection** — no survey responses or interview recordings are gathered until consent is documented
- **At first point of contact** — consent forms are attached to the initial outreach email and must be returned before participation
- For focus groups: consent collected verbally at session start and documented by facilitator

### 2.3 How Consent Is Collected

| Method | Use Case | Documentation |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Digital signature** (DocuSign) | Survey participants contacted via email | Signed PDF stored in secure project folder |
| **Online checkbox** (SurveyMonkey) | Anonymous survey respondents | Consent page as first survey page; must check "I agree" to proceed |
| **Paper form** | In-person focus groups or interviews | Scanned and uploaded within 24 hours |
| **Verbal consent** | Phone interviews | Recorded at start of call; notation added to tracking log |

### 2.4 Consent Form Contents
Each consent form includes:
- Study title, PI name, and institutional affiliation
- Purpose of the research in plain language
- What participation involves (time commitment, activities)
- Risks and benefits
- Data handling and confidentiality measures
- Voluntary participation statement and right to withdraw
- Contact information for questions or concerns

## 4. IRB Considerations

### 4.1 Classification
This study qualifies for **IRB exemption** under Category 2 (surveys/interviews with adult participants, no sensitive topics, no identifiable data linkage). An exemption determination letter is on file.

### 4.2 Data Privacy Measures
- All participant data stored in access-controlled cloud storage (Google Workspace with organization SSO)
- Identifiers (names, emails) stored separately from response data
- Participant IDs are the only link between consent records and data
- Reddit data is publicly posted content — no consent required, but usernames are stripped before analysis
- Data retention: Raw data deleted 12 months after study completion; anonymized dataset retained indefinitely

### 4.3 Withdrawal Protocol
1. Participant contacts PI via email or phone
2. PI marks participant as "Withdrawn" in tracking table within 24 hours
3. All identifiable data for that participant is permanently deleted within 48 hours
4. Participant receives confirmation email
